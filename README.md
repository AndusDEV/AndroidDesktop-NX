# Android Desktop on Switch
Android with desktop mode using Switchroot's Android 10 on Switch

## 1. Enable options in developer settings:
 1. Go to Settings
 2. If you haven't enabled developer settings:
      - Go to "About Tablet"
      - Tap the Build number until you see a message that says "You are now a developer!"
 3. Go to System -> Advanced -> Developer Settings
 4. Scroll down until you see "enable freeform windows" and "force desktop mode".
 5. When you find them, enable both, and restart Android.
## 2. Install the launcher:
 1. Install Taskbar ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farmerbb.taskbar) or [Github](https://github.com/farmerbb/Taskbar/releases)) by farmerbb.
 2. Open Taskbar's settings and enable 'Desktop Mode", grant the permission to display over other apps.
 3. Set Taskbar as your default home app.
 4. Set the "primary launcher" to whichever you're now using (Trebuchet by default). This will be the launcher outside of the Switch dock, or any USB-C to HDMI cable output.
## 3. See if it works:
Connect the Switch to Dock/Display. You should see a basic Desktop-like interface!
